## LESSON 1

### **Lesson Topic**: *Let’s Learn Programming Through Play!*

### **Objective**:  
Students understand that programming is about giving instructions and solving problems. They get to become programmers themselves through simple games and activities.

### **Lesson Structure**

#### **1. Introduction**

1. **Explain what programming is**:
   - "Programming is writing instructions. Computers and robots do exactly what we tell them – but they don’t know what to do unless we explain it!"
   - Example: "Imagine you have a tractor. The tractor doesn’t move unless you drive it. You have to make it go forward, turn left or right, pick up objects, or carry them."


2. **Example of instructions**:
   - Write on the board:
     1. Take 1 step forward.
     2. Turn left.
     3. Jump up.

   - Let student follow the instructions to demonstrate.

#### **2. Activities**

##### **A. "Programming the Robot" Game**
- Studend would be a programmer and teacher a robot (which is funny i know )"
- The programmer gives instructions like:
  - "Take two steps forward."
  - "Turn right."
  - "Pick up the pencil from the floor."
- The robot follows the instructions exactly. So if the instructions are unclear there could be "misunderstandings". For example, put more then one pencil on the floor, get confused "which hand i should use?" and so on. Idea is, that to get robot to do exactly what programmer needs, the instructions have to be precise and clear.
- **Extension**: Set a target, such as a desk with a toy or candy, that the "robot" must reach and bring back a toy or candy to the "programmer".

##### **B. Sequence Cards Game**
- The end goal would be getting a "treasure" from otherside of the room (lets use table with a candy or toy). Prepar the floor that there would be some "obsticles"
   - First step would be thinking how to get to the table.
   - Let student write down on cards the exact "commands" in correct order (for example: take 2 steps left; turn to right; take 3 steps front; take a sidestep to right to avoid the chair etc.)

### NOTE
Difference between those 2 games is, that programming happens in two steps. Thinking and writing. First, you come up with the plan, you think how it should happen, go through ideas and plans. Second, you write the down the program to give output for the ideas on hw to achive what you want to achieve.

#### **3. Wrap-Up and Discussion**

1. **Ask questions**:
   - "Why is it important for instructions to be clear?"
   - "Did the robot do exactly what you expected?"
   - "What does it mean to be a programmer?"

2. **Connect to computers and the real world**:
   - "When you learn to give good instructions, you can teach computers to do amazing things, like create games or control machines or even pilot spaceships remotely."
